# Rohan Bera

Need to make a portfolio. Waited too long. 

## Plan 

**Topics**
- Home (Rohan?)
- Skills
- Work Experience
- Projects (Diff page)
- About me? here? or above?
- Get in touch

**Plan**
- One page fixed bg, next page scroll
- So like alternating
- Projects in a diff page cuz i have a plan for that
- Maybe it better to fix matter first??
- - Meanwhile maybe ill do the routing and navbar
  
- **Projects page**
- - so like, itll have 2 columns
- - One is fixed, contains some Pixel art font 
- - other is scrollable, contains all Projects list 
- - Something retro? use a marquee tag maybe??
